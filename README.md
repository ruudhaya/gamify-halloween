# Gamify Halloween (WIP)

### How it works
A trick or treater will navigate to the create qr code endpoint and create a new qr code to print out and place on their costume or grab bag. They can then start going to houses asking if the treat passer can scan their QR code with their phone. It navigates to the unique url encoded in the QR code and tallies a point to that specific trick or treater. It will save a hash of the IP, timestamp and point. At the end of the night the trick or treater can check a status page to see where the trick or treater ranks among others in their locale. Listing points accumulated within a given time frame.

### Possible Recognition
Top trick or treaters will get a call out on the site, fb page, or other (still aggregating ideas)
